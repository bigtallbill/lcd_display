![CI](https://github.com/mnishiguchi/lcd_display/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

`LcdDisplay` allows you to control a [Hitachi HD44780](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller)-compatible
[Liquid-crystal display (LCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display) in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

For the specification of the HD44780 LCD, please refer to the [HD44780 data sheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/HD44780.pdf).

## Installation

You can install `LcdDisplay` by adding `lcd_display` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lcd_display, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Development with Nix

This project includes a Nix flake for reproducible development environments. If you're using NixOS or have Nix installed, you can quickly set up a development environment with all necessary dependencies.

### Using Nix Flakes

To enter the development environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

This will provide you with:
- Elixir 1.18 and Erlang 27
- All development tools (mix, hex, rebar3)
- Documentation tools
- Code analysis tools (credo, dialyzer)
- Hardware tools for embedded development (fwup, i2c-tools)

### Building with Nix

To build the project:

```bash
nix build
```

To run checks (formatting, compilation, tests):

```bash
nix flake check
```

### Using direnv (optional)

If you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed, the project includes a `.envrc` file that will automatically activate the Nix environment when you enter the project directory:

```bash
direnv allow
```

### Legacy Nix Support

For users not using flakes, a `shell.nix` file is also provided:

```bash
nix-shell
```

## Usage

As an example, if you want to control a [Hitachi HD44780](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller) type display through
the 8-bit I/O expander [PCF8574](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8574_PCF8574A.pdf),
you can use `LcdDisplay.HD44780.PCF8574` module as a display driver.

### Start an LCD driver and get a PID

```elixir
driver_config = %{
  driver_module: LcdDisplay.HD44780.PCF8574,
  i2c_bus: "i2c-1",          # I2C bus name
  i2c_address: 0x27,         # 7-bit address
  rows: 2,                   # the number of display rows
  cols: 16,                  # the number of display columns
  font_size: "5x8"           # "5x10" or "5x8"
}

{:ok, pid} = LcdDisplay.start_link(driver_config)
```

Many configuration values are optional, falling back to default values. Please refer to each display module documentation.

### Run commands

Please refer to the `LcdDisplay.HD44780.Driver` documentation for supported display commands.

```elixir
# Print text
LcdDisplay.execute(pid, {:print, "Hello world"})

# Clear the display
LcdDisplay.execute(pid, :clear)

# Print a character at a time
LcdDisplay.execute(pid, {:print, 0b00110001})
LcdDisplay.execute(pid, {:print, 0b00110000})
LcdDisplay.execute(pid, {:print, 0b00100101})
```

### Driver modules

Different products out there use different I/O expanders, so please be aware of which I/O expander you are using if you use something like an I2C backpack.
Also the pin assignment between the LCD and the I/O expander is important since this library assumes certain pin assignment based on popular products out there.

#### for parallel I/O

When you connect an LCD standalone directly to the GPIO pins on your target device, the `LcdDisplay.HD44780.GPIO` driver module is useful.

Here are some relevant products:

- [Adafruit Assembled Standard LCD 16x2 - White on Blue](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1447)
- [Adafruit Standard LCD 16x2 - white on blue](https://www.adafruit.com/product/181)
- [Adafruit Standard LCD 20x4 - white on blue](https://www.adafruit.com/product/198)
- [Adafruit RGB backlight LCD 16x2 - black on RGB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/398)
- [Adafruit RGB backlight LCD 16x2 - RGB on black](https://www.adafruit.com/product/399)

#### for PCF8574-based I2C modules

[Many inexpensive I2C modules on Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=i2c+16x2+lcd+module) uses [PCF8574](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8574_PCF8574A.pdf). A pre-assembled 16x2 LCD with I2C module is typically less than US$10. [Handson Technology I2C Serial Interface 1602 LCD Module User Guide](http://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/module/I2C_1602_LCD.pdf) summarizes the typical specifications of the PCF8574-based I2C module.

#### for Adafruit I2C / SPI character LCD backpack

The [Adafruit i2c / SPI character LCD backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/292) supports both I2C and SPI interfaces. It uses [MCP23008](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP23008-MCP23S08-Data-Sheet-20001919F.pdf) for I2C and [SN74HC595](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/scls041i/scls041i.pdf) for SPI as of writing.

#### for other I/O expanders

It is easy to make your own driver modules in case you want a custom pin assignment, a different I/O expander or some custom features.
